**Algorithm Selection**

*List the three classification algorithms you have chosen.
*Write a brief justification for why you have chosen them.
*For each algorithm, briefly describe the hyperparameters that you will explore and why. You do not have to explore all the hyperparameters; select the ones that you think will be the most important.

**Methodology**

*Explain your training procedure, including any further subdivision of the data.
*Describe how you have optimised the hyperparameters.
*Explain how you chose to measure and test algorithm performance.

**Results**

*Briefly summarise the results you have obtained.
*You may include graphs or tables, but these must be included within the page count.
*Identify and explain any notable features of the results. For example, are there any classes that are frequently confused?

**Conclusion**

*Analyse and explain your results, noting, for example, any particular sensitivity or insensitivity of an algorithm to the values of a particular hyperparameter.
*Suggest why you think your best performing algorithm was superior to your other choices.
